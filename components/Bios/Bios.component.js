    bio: `Established in 2019, Killer Whale is the brainchild of Dylan Shively, an experienced trader, software engineer and entrepreneur. 

    Being an early adopter of crypto, Dylan saw a flood of new traders enter the market, some made it big, others lost everything. 
    
    What sets the successful traders apart from the majority? 
    They understand market conditions, do not let emotions cloud their judgement and look for the optimum time to buy and sell - in summary they had a strategy! 
    
    Dylan created Killer Whale as a way for new traders to have access to the same skills and strategies of experienced traders, levelling the playing field.
